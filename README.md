Assignment 1 for CIS 3500 - Software Engineering

### Overview
In this assignment, I followed along the first chapter of Build Websites with Hugo in order to generate a site with Hugo for the first time. The site has a home page and three content pages - about, resume, and contact.

### Building the Site
To build the site, run the following command:
```
hugo
```
This will generate the static files in the public directory.

### Running the Site Locally
To run the site locally, use the following command:
```
hugo server
```
This will start a local server at http://localhost:1313/.
